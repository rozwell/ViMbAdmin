/**
 * The AccessPermissions plugin
 *
 * AccessPermissions were part of the main ViMbAdmin code but I have shunted them to a
 * plugin to demonstrate and prove the arcitecture. It's a slight cheat as AccessPermissions
 * rely on a specific column in the Mailbox database table which plugins should typically
 * avoid.
